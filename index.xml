      <title>Balance checks</title>

      <description>A recurring discussion on Twitter and other social media is whether one should or should not check baseline covariates for balance in a randomized experiment. The discussion comes in various flavors, sometimes focusing on whether the very act of balance checks are meaningful, or whether randomization actually is or is not expected to yield balance, and whether something should or should not be done about unbalanced covariates. Stephen Senn has written a paper on this called “Seven myths of randomisation in clinical trials” (http://onlinelibrary.</description>

      <title>Non-transitive dice</title>

      <description>About ten years ago I bought myself a set of non-transitive dice. I have occasionally used them in class, but I am afraid that I am more excited about these dice than the average student. The main idea behind non-transitive dice is that out of a set of dice (and under repeated rolls), one die (A) will on average show a higher value than another die (B), and therefore beat it in a game in which the highest roll wins, but at the same time this winning die (A) will be dominated by another die (C), which itself loses to the loser of the first competition (B).</description>

      <title>Rounding in the age of statcheck</title>

      <description>I recently chatted with a colleague whose work was flagged on PubPeer by the statcheck bot that has been scraping the web last year or so. Her reaction - which I believe is pretty typical - was mild annoyance. To her (and I believe many others) it felt a bit pedantic to be flagged what was essentially a rounding error. She feared that such a flag may create a false impression that the work is a “false positive”, and that people jump to conclusions when they see a statcheck error.</description>

      <title>Keeping exploratory and confirmatory analyses strictly separate</title>

      <description>Recently Wang et al. published a paper in the Journal of Experimental Psychology on pre-registered analyses and the use of covariates in un-registered, exploratory, post-hoc analyses, specifically in the context of randomized experiments 1.
I am in 100% agreement with the vast majority of what the authors have to say, and also with the general sentiment of the paper, which I summarize as follows:
1.) Pre-register your analyses and report the results of your pre-registration fully</description>

      <description>As Rich Lucas recently said, it seems somewhat anachronistic to start a blog in 2017, but here I am… doing it anyway.
Well, I worry that starting a blog in 2017 is a bit like creating a myspace page in 2010, but here goes: https://t.co/12RevfumqL

      <description>Academic Biosketch Felix Thoemmes is an assistant professor in the department of Human Development, with joint appointment in the Department of Psychology, at Cornell University. His research interests are causal inference, especially using structural equation models, or propensity scores, missing data, and open science. Before coming to Cornell, he was an assistant professor at Texas A&amp;amp;M University, and the University of Tubingen, Germany.

      <description>I subscribe to principles of open science and reproducible research. I have signed the commitment to research transparency, originally developed by Felix Schönbrodt. I encourage you to read the twelve points of this commitment, but in brief, signatories try to provide raw data, and reproducible computer code, with every submitted manuscript, and ask for both of these from other authors whose work they are reviewing.   I am also a signatory of the Peer Reviewers&amp;rsquo; Openness Initiative, originally developed by Richard Morey, and others.</description>

      <description>Regression-discontinuity designs In 2014 I was funded by the Institute for Education Sciences (IES) to develop a user-friendly software for educational researchers to perform the analysis of a regression-discontinuity design (RDD). There are already several R packages available that perform these analyses, but we wanted to also provide a graphical user interface, and also add new features. We chose R Shiny to program our graphical interface, and we have added some functionality that is not covered by existing R packages.</description>

      <description>I offer Quantitative Methods (QM) 1, and 2, on a regular basis, and QM 3 on a somehwat irregular basis. All courses are cross-listed between Human Development and Psychology, and are open to graduate students and advanced undergraduate students. In the past I also taught Introduction to Research Methods for undergraduates. Each semester, I offer a reading group (together with my colleague Anthony Ong) that is focused on methods. It is called MSG (Methods Study Group).</description>
