      <description>Part OneOne morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.
He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.
The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.</description>

      <description>I subscribe to principles of open science and reproducible research. I have signed the commitment to research transparency, originally developed by Felix Schönbrodt. I encourage you to read the twelve points of this commitment, but in brief, signatories try to provide raw data, and reproducible computer code, with every submitted manuscript, and ask for both of these from other authors whose work they are reviewing.   I am also a signatory of the Peer Reviewers&amp;rsquo; Openness Initiative, originally developed by Richard Morey, and others.</description>

      <description>Regression-discontinuity designs In 2014 I was funded by the Institute for Education Sciences (IES) to develop a user-friendly software for educational researchers to perform the analysis of a regression-discontinuity design (RDD). There are already several R packages available that perform these analyses, but we wanted to also provide a graphical user interface, and also add new features. We chose R Shiny to program our graphical interface, and we have added some functionality that is not covered by existing R packages.</description>

      <description>I offer Quantitative Methods (QM) 1, and 2, on a regular basis, and QM 3 on a somehwat irregular basis. All courses are cross-listed between Human Development and Psychology, and are open to graduate students and advanced undergraduate students. In the past I also taught Introduction to Research Methods for undergraduates. Each semester, I offer a reading group (together with my colleague Anthony Ong) that is focused on methods. It is called MSG (Methods Study Group).</description>
