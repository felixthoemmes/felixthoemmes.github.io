      <description>Inspired by a recent discussion on SEMNET, I decided to publish a short blog post about the front-door criterion. The front-door criterion was developed by Judea Pearl, as a means to identify and estimate a causal effect in the presence of unobserved confounders.
Consider the following DAG (directed acyclical graph) in which a treatment X has an effect on an outcome Y. This effect however cannot directly be estimated without bias, because there is an unobserved confounder U.</description>
