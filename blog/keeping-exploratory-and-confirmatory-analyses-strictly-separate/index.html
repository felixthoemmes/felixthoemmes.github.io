                <p>Recently <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103116308095">Wang et al.</a> published a paper in the Journal of Experimental Psychology on pre-registered analyses and the use of covariates in un-registered, exploratory, post-hoc analyses, specifically in the context of randomized experiments <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>I am in 100% agreement with the vast majority of what the authors have to say, and also with the general sentiment of the paper, which I summarize as follows:</p>
<p>1.) Pre-register your analyses and report the results of your pre-registration fully<br />
2.) If you decide to run an unregistered analysis, mark it as exploratory</p>
<p>This is pretty much exactly what I teach my students, what I tell my collaborators, and what I try to do myself in all of my own projects. I think it is wonderful that this is so clearly expressed in this paper, because it’s an important message that deserves to be spread.</p>
<p>Wang et al. then continue to discuss how adding a covariate (preferably one that is strongly related to the outcome) in a data-dependent fashion influences both Type I error and power (hence Type II error). They are only considering a situation in which the treatment was randomized, but in which the inclusion of the covariate was not pre-registered, and is thus exploratory, data-dependent (because it is only done if the unadjusted effect is not significant), and post-hoc. Their argument is simple and straight-forward: the inclusion of such a covariate can greatly decrease Type II errors (because power is increased), and will only increase Type I errors a bit (they are increased because a data-dependent additional analysis is performed). They quantify these errors in a simulation study, and pitch this strategy as one of smart post-hoc exploration of an insignificant result. I think it is also fair to say that they elevate this particular strategy to a special place in all of the exploratory analyses that could have been done. They note e.g., in a supplement that also including the interaction of the covariate and the treatment might not be a good idea, because Type I error inflation seems too high.</p>
<p>Where exactly is my objection? It’s based on a possibly overly strict desire of keeping exploratory and confirmatory research separate from each other. I feel that in Wang et al.’s recommendation they introduce essentially a gray area between the two. To be completely fair, they explicitly note that one should label pre-registered results as confirmatory, and post-hoc as exploratory results, but I think it is also fair to say that they do give a special place for this one particular technique (the estimation of a covariate-adjusted effect using the linear term of a covariate). They consider it a smart way to do a data-dependent post-hoch, exploratory analysis. An applied researcher could easily interpret this as follows: If my original pre-registered analysis does not yield p &lt; .05, then Wang et al. tell me that I now have ONE, and only one, additional shot at p &lt; .05, which is to include a single covariate. If I get p &lt; .05 in that analysis, I still label it as exploratory, but this is somewhat more sanctified than if I had done a whole bunch of other analyses, and it somehow edges more closer to the confirmatory realm.</p>
<p>I would recommend (just as Wang et al.) to label pre-registered results as confirmatory tests of hypotheses. All exploratory results should be labeled and treated as exploratory. That means if you didn’t find the desired effect in your pre-registered results, and only find it once you adjust for a covariate, then this finding should not be used to imply confirmatory evidence for your hypothesis. In addition, and this is contrary to Wang et al. I would not place any limit on the exploratory analyses that one can engage in, as long as they are reported in full, and all labeld as exploratory. Here is why: conducting an exploratory analysis implies just that - being exploratory. Once you are not in confirmation mode anymore, you should be encouraged to be exploratory. Whatever results you find, do not treat them as hypothesis-conforming, but hypothesis-generating, and if possible, follow them up with a replication. As an example, Wang et al. note that the interaction between the covariate and the treatment should not be probed in a data-dependent fashion. What, however, if this interaction is part of the data-generating model (“the ground truth”)? This is exactly what we would like to find in an exploratory fashion - and then, of course, follow-up with a pre-registered replication for any effect that we found.</p>
<p>One thing I should mention is that there might be a misconception among researchers that once you have a pre-registration in place, your hands are tied not to do any other analysis (Wang et al. describe such a person who never conducts any additional analyses in their paper). I am not sure how widespread this belief is, but there is really nothing that prevents a researcher from doing additional, exploratory, post-hoc, data-dependent, snooping analyses (as long as they are labeled exploratory and are reported in full!). The pre-registration “only” provides a demarcation line between hypothesis-conforming and hypothesis-generating research, prevents HARKing (Hypothesizing after results are known), and keeps researchers honest. So if this is a widespread belief, then the Wang et al. paper is again doing a great job of dispelling it.</p>
<p>P.S. Uli Schimmack actually beat me to this conclusion, and posted it on the Psych Methods Facebook page…</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>While I don’t know the authors of this paper, for full disclosure, I should mention that the senior author of this paper, Alison Ledgerwood, was the editor on a paper of mine for Perspectives on Psychological Science. She was an outstanding editor - in fact one of the best I have ever worked with. I felt it’s important to express this here, because if anything, I am positively biased against her, and I am also not directing my criticism directly at her as a person.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
