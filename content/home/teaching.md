I offer Quantiative Methods (QM) 1, 2, and 3 on a regular basis. All courses are cross-listed between Human Development and Psychology, and are open to graduate students and advanced undergraduate students. QM1 is a course on the analysis of randomized studies (mostly ANOVA designs), QM2 focuses on the analysis of non-randomized studies (mostly regression), and QM3 covers a mix of more advanced statistical methods. In addition, I offer a bi-weekly reading group (called the methods study group, or short MSG) on current methods each semester. Occassionaly, I also teach undergraduate research methods.
